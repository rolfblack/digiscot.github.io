## Project plan

### Project description

In light of the growing potential of iPads (and other mobile technologies) to meet the diverse needs of people with aphasia and the need to support them in their use of such technologies, we want to establish a pilot support group where adults with aphasia can explore the benefits of technology and gain the skills required to access these tools within a structured environment. The overall goal is to develop and evaluate a framework for establishing a technology support group for people with aphasia which can be rolled out in other settings.

## Project milestones

The Assistive Technology Research Assistant started 1st May 2015. He had been working with the iPad group for over a year as part of his post at the University of Dundee. The new grant allowed the formal establishment of the group and the resources to support the development of similar groups in Scotland.

### Confirm venue and schedule for regular meetings

The group had previously met in the Queen Mother Building at the University of Dundee. Here we have several options:

1.	The User Centre space: The User Centre has been established in 2005 and is lead by older people who meet regularly to work on their computers together. This includes everything from working with photos, text documents and spread sheets to surfing the internet. The space is equipped with computers and reserved for User Centre meetings every morning. The User Centre Space is ideal for drop-in sessions where people can get help for specific problems.
2.	The “Street”: Adjacent to the User Centre is a large open space with big tables that allows groups to meet and work. The initial meetings of the Aphasia iPad group took place in the “Street”.
3.	The Seminar Room: We were planning to move into this quieter and bigger room with the group since it provided a space more suitable for un-interrupted group work.

### Advertise the group through print and online media

A printed information postcard was designed and produced to be circulated with interested parties. The involved Speech and Language Therapists took the print media to colleagues and Special Interest Groups (SIG) for distribution.

A web page on the Dundee AAC website was established, informing about key points of the group, meeting times and way descriptions to the venue.

## Evaluation

We have been collecting data during the group sessions we will be analysing at the beginning of 2016.

Following some preliminary results on communication within the group.

### Communication within the Group

We discussed and trialled a number of online communication methods to find a reliable and accessible way to share information.
Email communication via an email discussion list turned out to be the most reliable and accessible way to share information with the group. We chose a to establish a Google mailing list which allowed group members to mail to a unique group email address to reach everyone in the group and simplified responses to the group. Group members could join by invitation and stay on the mailing list even after they had left the group to receive on-going information.


### Outputs and outcomes

Overall this project was very much enjoyed by the group and a number of new members from as far as Glasgow. The new member from Glasgow is now involved in the setup of a new group on the west coast.

In terms of outputs we established accounts on social media: Facebook and Twitter. For the group sessions a number of short manuals were produced to illustrate the use of different apps and accessibility features. These will be published online in the next few months.

We also presented our work at the national conference of Communication Matters, a charity for supporting communication for people with a speech impairment.

#### Animation Workshop

In 2016 during an 8 week workshop with Andrew Low, initiated by Chris Kelly (THAT), the Tap and Talk Aphasia iPad Group have created two animation short films about aphasia. 

The workshop was made possible through funding by the NHS Tayside Healthcare Arts Trust THAT with support of Computing at the School of Science and Engineering, University of Dundee, and the volunteers that donated their time.
